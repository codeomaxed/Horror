# Progress: MystOS Recovery Environment

## 1. What Works

The following core components and functionalities are implemented and working:

*   **Initial Load & Boot.**
*   **Desktop Environment.**
*   **Windowing System:**
    *   Draggable, front-bringable, closable windows for File Explorer, Recycle Bin, Dialogs, CMD, Password Prompt, Video Player.
    *   **Resizable Windows:** All standard windows now have a bottom-right resize handle and can be resized by the user. Logic constrains size within desktop boundaries and respects `min-width`/`min-height`.
*   **File Explorer:**
    *   Navigation, file/folder listing, `feUpButton`.
    *   Handles opening various file types, including videos via Video Player.
    *   Correct icons for `.vlog` files.
*   **Recycle Bin.**
*   **Dialog System.**
*   **Context Menus.**
*   **Sound System.**
*   **Shutdown Sequence.**
*   **Subtle Glitch Effects.**
*   **Video Player:**
    *   HTML structure and CSS styling in place.
    *   **Default window size increased to 960x540px.**
    *   Draggable, closable, and **resizable window.**
    *   `closeWindow()` pauses video and resets player.
    *   `fileSystem` updated with actual relative paths to video files in the `videos/` folder.
    *   `openVideoPlayer()` function loads video `src`, handles corrupted state, and opens the window.
    *   Basic video event listeners update a status bar.
    *   `openFile()` calls `openVideoPlayer()` for `.mp4` and `.vlog` files.
    *   **Browser default video controls are enabled.**

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refine

*   **Video Player Enhancements:**
    *   Implement custom video controls if default browser controls are not desired.
    *   More robust error handling.
    *   Consider a "loading" indicator.
    *   **Thorough testing of playback and resizing for all integrated videos.**
*   **Narrative Content Integration.**
*   **Recycle Bin Context Menu.**
*   **`emptyRecycleBin()` Confirmation.**
*   **`showDialog()` Enhancements.**
*   **Full Functionality of Start Menu Items.**
*   **Batch File Execution (`.bat`) Enhancements.**
*   **Visual Feedback & UI Polish:**
    *   Refine resize handle appearance if needed.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Project Pivot Successful & Documented.**
*   **Glitch Effects Implemented & Stable.**
*   **Core OS Simulation Stable.**
*   **UI Enhancements:**
    *   All windows are now resizable.
    *   Video player default size increased.
*   **Video Player - Phase 2 Progress:**
    *   Foundation for video playback is in place, using actual video file paths.
*   **Memory Bank Update for UI Enhancements In Progress.**

## 4. Known Issues

*   No major known bugs in core OS features or glitch effects.
*   Video player currently uses browser default controls.
*   **Playback and resizing of newly integrated videos need thorough testing by the user.**
*   Placeholder for `emptyRecycleBin` confirmation dialog remains.
