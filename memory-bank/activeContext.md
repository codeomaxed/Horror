# Active Context: MystOS Recovery Environment

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current work focus is **Phase 2: Video Player Implementation** and **UI Enhancements**.
Key recent changes include:
*   Updating the `fileSystem` object in `script.js` to use actual relative paths to video files (`videos/horror1.mp4`, etc.).
*   Increasing the default size of the video player window.
*   Implementing resizable functionality for all windows.

## 2. Recent Changes (This Work Cycle)

*   **Window Resizing Implemented:**
    *   Added resize handles (`<div class="window-resize-handle"></div>`) to all relevant window structures in `index.html`.
    *   Added CSS for `.window-resize-handle` in `style.css` to position it and set the resize cursor.
    *   Added global variables (`resizeStartX`, `resizeStartY`, `initialWidth`, `initialHeight`) to `script.js` for managing resize state.
    *   Implemented a `makeResizable(windowElement)` function in `script.js` that:
        *   Attaches `mousedown` listeners to resize handles.
        *   On `mousedown`, records initial mouse/window dimensions and attaches `mousemove`/`mouseup` listeners to the document.
        *   On `mousemove`, calculates and applies new window dimensions, respecting `min-width`/`min-height` and desktop boundaries.
        *   On `mouseup`, removes document listeners.
    *   Updated `initializeDesktop()` in `script.js` to call `makeResizable(win)` for all standard windows.
*   **Video Player Window Size:**
    *   Increased the default `width` and `height` of `#video-player-window` in `style.css` to `960px` and `540px` respectively.
*   **Video Player Controls:**
    *   Added the `controls` attribute to the `<video>` tag in `index.html` to enable default browser video controls.
*   **Video File Integration:**
    *   Updated the `fileSystem` object in `script.js` with actual relative paths to video files in the `videos/` folder.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Update Memory Bank:** (This task)
    *   Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (This file - In Progress).
    *   Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
    *   Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
    *   Update `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
2.  **Testing Video Playback & Window Resizing:**
    *   User to test opening video files and verify playback with controls.
    *   User to test resizing all windows, including the video player.
3.  **Video Player - Further Enhancements (Post-Testing):**
    *   Implement custom video controls if needed.
    *   Refine error handling.
    *   Consider a "loading" spinner.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Window Resizing Logic:** The current implementation uses a bottom-right handle and constrains resizing within desktop boundaries.
*   **Video Player Size:** The default size is now larger. Resizing allows further adjustment. The `object-fit: contain;` CSS property on the video element should maintain aspect ratio during resize.
*   **Performance:** Resizing logic, especially `mousemove` events, can be performance-intensive. Current implementation is standard; optimizations might be needed if lag is observed.
