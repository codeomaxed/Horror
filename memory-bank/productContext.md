# Product Context: MystOS Recovery Environment

## 1. Why This Project Exists

This project exists to create a captivating and immersive web-based simulation of a corrupted, retro-style operating system. It serves as the **primary interactive medium for a YouTube horror/ARG series**, delivering a **grounded and twisted narrative** through discoverable clues, unsettling system behaviors, and **embedded video logs**. The simulation aims to be a unique storytelling platform, moving beyond passive viewing to active participation in the unfolding mystery.

## 2. Problem It Solves / Experience It Provides

Instead of solving a traditional "problem," this project aims to:

*   **Provide a Unique Interactive Narrative Experience:** Offers users/viewers a chance to explore a mysterious and unstable digital environment that directly tells a story. The experience is central to the YouTube series.
*   **Evoke Nostalgia, Curiosity, and Unease:** The retro OS aesthetic and "glitchy" behavior (including **Cursor Stutter, Wrong Character Flicker, Window Breathe**) evoke nostalgia while piquing curiosity and creating an unsettling atmosphere aligned with the horror theme.
*   **Facilitate Narrative Discovery:** The presence of specific, intriguingly named files, corrupted elements, and especially **discoverable video logs (.vlog files)**, forms the core of the narrative that users/viewers uncover by interacting with the system.
*   **Entertain and Engage through Horror Storytelling:** The primary goal is to entertain and deeply engage users/viewers through exploration, discovery, and the unsettling, analog horror-infused atmosphere of a malfunctioning OS that holds dark secrets.

## 3. How It Should Ideally Work (User Perspective)

From a user's/viewer's perspective, the MystOS Recovery Environment should:

*   **Be Immediately Intriguing and Unsettling:** The initial boot sequence and OS loading screen should draw the user in, setting a tone of mystery and unease consistent with a horror experience.
*   **Offer Recognizable OS Interactions:** Users should be able to interact with desktop icons, use a start menu, open and close windows, and navigate a file system in a way that is reminiscent of older graphical operating systems, making the discovery of narrative elements feel organic.
*   **Respond to User Actions with Narrative Significance:** Clicks, drags, and menu selections should trigger appropriate responses, which may include "glitchy" behavior or lead to the discovery of narrative content (e.g., opening a video log).
*   **Encourage Exploration for Narrative Clues:** Users should feel compelled to explore the file system, attempt to open files (especially video logs), and interact with different UI elements to uncover parts of the story.
*   **Maintain an Atmosphere of Instability and Dread:** The **subtle, rare glitch effects**, error messages, corrupted files, and sound effects should consistently reinforce the theme of a malfunctioning, haunted, or deeply compromised OS.
*   **Deliver a Coherent, Discoverable Story:** Interactions should guide users/viewers through fragments of information, culminating in a cohesive (though potentially disturbing) narrative primarily delivered via video logs and environmental clues.
*   **Provide a Sense of Uncovering a Mystery:** Finding "hidden" files, "corrupted" data, or successfully playing a video log should feel like significant progress in understanding the underlying horror story.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Goals

*   **Immersion in a Horror Narrative:** Create a believable (within its fictional context) and engaging simulation that makes users/viewers feel like they are truly interacting with the "MystOS" and experiencing its dark story firsthand.
*   **Atmosphere of Analog Horror:** Cultivate a specific mood – a mix of nostalgia, mystery, pervasive unease, and dread – through visuals, sounds, interactive behaviors, and the implemented glitch effects.
*   **Intuitiveness for Narrative Access:** While the OS is "broken," basic interactions should be familiar enough for users to navigate and access narrative content (like video logs) without excessive frustration.
*   **Deep Engagement with the Story:** Keep users/viewers invested in exploring the environment, discovering its secrets, and piecing together the horror narrative.
*   **Rewarding Narrative Discovery:** Encourage users to click around, try to open things, and see what happens, leading to a sense of uncovering hidden aspects of the simulation and its story.
